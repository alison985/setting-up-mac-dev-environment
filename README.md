This repository started as "How to Setup a Mac Development Environment" because I didn't want to miss steps when setting up a computer. I will not be changing the name of the repo at this time to assist in keeping it findable for others.

I've expanded this repo into other computer OSes and general tech stack environments so I have all I need in one place. 
* [Ubuntu 22.04 on my Framework Laptop](ubuntu-22.04_jammy_framework.md)
* [Mac OS](mac-os_thru_2021.md)
* [AWS](aws.md)

I've started another project in it for easy sharing. Note, searching Github gets you way more content.
* [De-Google Your Life](de-google.md)
