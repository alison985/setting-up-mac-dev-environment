1. Know which registrar you're transferring it to. Have a user account setup with that registrar. In my case, namecheap.com.
2. In Google's domain site click on domain name, scroll to the bottom of the page, and make or enure the domain is not locked.
3. Get the transfer out code (aka auth code) from Google.
4. Go to [Namecheap.com Transfer Domain page](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/transfer/). Enter domain name and submit.
5. Confirm details and paste auth code and submit.
6. Complete shopping cart to renew for a year.
7. (Blocked. Namecheap won't allow me to set it) Configure DNS in namecheap so that the domain doesn't stop working during the transfer.
8. Wait 5-7 days.
9. Make sure it works
