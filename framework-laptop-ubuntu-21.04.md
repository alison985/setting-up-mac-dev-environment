## Opinions on Ordering a Laptop
1. You do NOT want vPro in your Wifi.

## Current Assumptions
1. By default 
    * Some level of Wi-fi works
    * Firefox is installed
    * External Monitor plug-in work
    * Connecting a printer works
1. You want a computer mirroring Alison's setup. Hence, mix-and-match as desired - please just understand the risks or investigate further or ask a friend/internet.
1. These instructions will get out of date relatively quickly.

## TODO
